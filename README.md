## üé® Customization

### Adding New Texts
Edit the `textSets` object in `game.js` to add new typing challenges:

```javascript
const textSets = {
    easy: [
        "Your new easy text here...",
        // Add more texts
    ],
    // Add to other difficulties
};
```

### Modifying Power-ups
Adjust power-up effects in the `activatePowerup` method:

```javascript
case 'speedBoost':
    // Modify duration, multiplier, etc.
    break;
```

### Styling Changes
Customize the appearance by editing `styles.css`. The design uses CSS custom properties for easy theming.
