## üìÅ Project Structure

```
/scenes/
  /player/        - Player character and abilities

  /rooms/         - Room templates and generation
  /main/          - Main game scene
  /ui/            - User interface elements
  /pickups/       - Collectible items

/scripts/
  /core/          - Core game classes (Player, Enemy, Room, etc.)
  /systems/       - Game systems (RoomGenerator, UIManager, etc.)

/assets/
  /placeholder/   - Placeholder art assets (colored rectangles)
```

## üîß How to Expand

### Adding New Enemies
1. Create new enemy script extending `Enemy` class
2. Override AI behavior methods as needed
3. Create new enemy scene in `/scenes/enemies/`
4. Add to room generation system

### Adding New Biomes
1. Create new room templates in `/scenes/rooms/`
2. Add biome to `RoomGenerator.room_templates` dictionary
3. Update `GameManager.starting_biome` or add biome progression

### Adding New Abilities
1. Add input actions to `project.godot`
2. Implement ability logic in `Player.gd`
3. Create projectile/effect scenes as needed
4. Add UI elements for cooldowns/resources

### Adding New Room Elements
1. Create new platform/obstacle scenes
2. Add to room templates or procedural generation
3. Update collision layers as needed

## üé® Visual Style

Currently using placeholder colored rectangles:
- **Player**: Cyan rectangle (40x60px)
- **Enemies**: Red rectangles (32x48px) 
- **Platforms**: Gray rectangles
- **Projectiles**: Magenta rectangles
- **Memory Fragments**: Cyan squares with floating animation

Replace these with actual sprites by updating the respective scene files.

## üöÄ Next Steps

This foundation is ready for expansion. Consider adding:

1. **More Biomes**: Luminous Abyss, Whispering Halls, Oblivion Root
2. **Weapon System**: Different weapon types with unique attacks
3. **Upgrade System**: Permanent progression between runs
4. **Boss Enemies**: Challenging encounters with multiple phases
5. **Environmental Hazards**: Spikes, moving platforms, etc.
6. **Audio System**: Sound effects and atmospheric music
7. **Particle Effects**: Visual polish for attacks and abilities
8. **Save System**: Progress persistence between sessions

## üêõ Known Issues

- Collision shapes in room templates needed manual fixes (completed)
- Camera smoothing could use fine-tuning for different screen sizes
- Enemy AI could be more sophisticated (basic patrol/chase currently)

## üîó Technical Notes

- Built for Godot 4.4.1
- Uses GDScript throughout
- Collision layers are properly configured
- Signal-based architecture for clean separation
- Modular design allows easy expansion
- All scripts are well-commented for maintainability

The game is fully playable - run the Main.tscn scene to start exploring the Ashen Courtyard!
